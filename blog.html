                    <p class="featured-excerpt">Air pollution is considered the greatest
environmental public health risk in Ghana. The use
of solid biomass, coal and kerosene for household
needs (70% of the population) is the main
contributor to household air pollution13, emitting
CO, NO2, SO2 and particulate matter (PM). The
government plans adoption of 2 million efficient
household cookstoves by 203014, with a bilateral
agreement with Switzerland to catalyse private
sector investment in clean cookstoves. Ambient
air pollution (AAP) is highest in urban areas due to
the high population density, traffic congestion,
Saharan dust and polluting industries such as ewaste burning. Exposure to PM2.5 levels above
WHO guidelines affects the entire population, with
the greatest impacts on the poor,.</p>

                        <p class="card-excerpt">Over 500,000 tonnes of e-waste were generated
between 2010 and 2016. Besides domestic
disposal, e-waste is imported, thus circumventing
Basel Convention rules and reflecting weak
regulatory enforcement. The extraction of metals
from e-waste pollutes the air (PM2.5, CFCs, dioxins,
PCBs and other carcinogens), especially from
burning plastic cables; the ground with remnant
metals; and watercourses, groundwater and the
Gulf of Guinea. The Hazardous and Electronic
Waste Control and Management Act 2016 (Act
917) provides for the establishment of an Electrical
and Electronic Waste Management Fund to
finance modern e-waste recycling facilities,
research and reporting, and education and
awareness. Infrastructure is absent for safe
disposal of hazardous waste.19.</p>

                        <p class="card-excerpt">In 2023, Ghana emitted around 52 million tons of greenhouse gases, (about 1.5 tons per person), equivalent to around 0.1% of the global total emissions.[12]

In 2021, Ghana's total CO2 emissions from fuel combustion in the energy sector reached 21.397 million tones, highlighting a significant increase of 332% in per-capita emissions since 2000.[13] Despite representing only 0.1% of global emissions from inflammable fuels, this rise is concerning, particularly in international efforts to mitigate climate change impacts. West Africa is among the smallest contributors to global greenhouse gas emissions, but the nations "are already feeling the effects of the climate catastrophe disproportionately".[14]

The primary source of these emissions in Ghana was oil burning, which accounted for 66% of the total CO2 emissions from fuel burning. Sector-wise, transportation emerged as the largest contributor, responsible for 47% of the nation's energy-related CO2 emissions, followed by electricity and heat production at 34%. These figures underscore the urgent need for Ghana to transition towards more sustainable energy sources and improve the efficiency of its transportation and power sectors.[15]

Carbon dioxide (CO2) makes up the vast majority of greenhouse gas emissions from the sector, but smaller amounts of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are also emitted. These gases are released during the combustion of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, to produce electricity.</p>

the energy sector is facing annual growth in
demand of 10-12%27 and is a key driver of
economic and social development. Yet, security,
reliability and universal access to electricity
remain a challenge. Average electricity access
reached 85% in 2019, with urban populations at
100% compared to rural at 70.5%. This compares
to 2010 with an average of 64.4%28, though
regional variations between 47.7% and 93.7%
remain (2017). 2012-2016 saw a spate of power
shortages (locally known as “dumsor”) which
wreaked havoc on the economy, industry and
communities29.
Total GHG emissions in 2016 were 42.15MtCO2e,
dominated by AFOLU30 at 54%, followed by energy
at 36%. This represents an overall increase of
66.3% during 1990-2016, with the largest in
energy at 302.7% and waste at 210.8%.31 Peak
demand for 2021 is projected at 3,304MW, an
increase from 2020. This compares to an installed
capacity of 5,288.1MW (4,842MW dependable)32. </p>

rainfall variability in the forest zones, highest
temperatures in the savannah zones, higher
likelihood of floods with 10% of the country being
highly hazardous, and droughts, particularly in the
savannah regions of Ghana. Flooding due to highintensity rainfall, land degradation and dumping of
solid waste compromise the already inadequate
flood management systems, in addition to farms
being located in floodplains. Crop yields are
already decreasing with limited water due to
deforestation, low rainfall, and inadequate water
harvesting. Heat stress and drought-related death
are evident in northern regions, affecting people
and livestock. Rainfall variability is particularly
significant in the transition and forest zones. This
is being detrimental to cocoa, mango, papaya, and
other fruit yields.1 With expected population
growth and planned economic growth, demands
on water for drinking, sanitation, hydropower, and
both rain-fed and irrigated agriculture will come
under increasing threat. Ghana is projrcts.</p>
